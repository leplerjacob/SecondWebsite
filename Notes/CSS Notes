These notes will be for you on how to start developing your first website

1. Start with boilerplate, including any additional frameworks or resources like fontawesome, link tags, script:src tags
    - 1.1 The "golden ratio" for line-height is 1.6. May be 1.64####.

2. Typical website will have a header/navbar class or section. Start with that
    2.1 Header > .navbar > (h1 > span > i - i < span < h1) | (nav > ul > (li - li) * # < ul < nav) < .navbar | .content > h1 - h1 | p - p | a > i - i < a <.content < header
    
    2.2 Mind classes or id's. For the first header tag, you have a class. Then for navbar, you have both class and id, and for ul,li,a, there are no classes or id's

        You can target the ul,li, or a tags with the parent element classes/id's.

3. While constructing the .navbar CSS, I had question of "What is the difference between align-items and align-content???". In this context, let's think of flex items with flex-direction row, which, is done by default when initially calling display:flex.
    3.1 Align-items, in a row, controls the vertical placement of all the items in each row. Align-content can control the space between each line of elements vertically

4. There is no difference between background and background-color. Think of background as background-*. There is:
    - background-color, background-image, etc...
    - all of those parameters can be set by just using background

5. Create flex container for the showcase text. This includes any p, h#, or links. 

6. Remember that a div with no height or width specified nor reference for such, only the content within the element will make up the height or width. In other words, it is stretched to fit items only
